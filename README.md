# Gettting Started With Faraday

## Frontend extension
Run the following commands to build the project.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Faraday-PM/faraday-frontend.git
cd faraday-frontend
npm i -y
npm run build
```
Then go to ``chrome://extensions``. Hit ``Load Unpacked`` and select the build folder. 
**Note: **A chrome extension is coming. Need to pass review first.


## Backend
Run the following commands.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Faraday-PM/Faraday-backend.git
cd faraday-backend
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
.\run
```
The server should now be started locally. A docker file will be coming soon.
